# README

This repository contains a set of simple machine learning programs. EX1 is designed to tackle problems based on one set of inputs using a linear model, while EX2 has multiple ways to handle a classification problem with up to two sets of inputs.

For each solution, the directory consists of the main program and two or more helper programs containing functions. Running the main program runs the machine learning.
